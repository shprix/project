Mizoguchi, the stuttering son of a poor and terminally ill Japanese priest, has from childhood been obsessed with the ***Golden Temple (Kinkaku-ji)*** of Kyoto which his father has spoken him so much about. In the shadow of his father’s early death he joins the temple as to become a buddhist priest, yet his fascination with the temple’s magnificence and with beauty itself changes as his insecurities devour him, plummeting him into recklessness and self-destructiveness, culminating at 2:30AM on July 2nd 1950, when disaster struck post-war Japan. 


***“Let the darkness of my heart […] equal the darkness of the night which encloses those countless lights!”***


Mishima was by no means a modern man; in fact, quite on the contrary. He was a right-winger, a traditionalist with a great love for Japanese culture and great devotion to the emperor, and a great hate for the westernisation that came with losing the war, and this is all very well reflected in **“The Temple of the Golden Pavilion”** — the book is infused with a rage towards the weakness and indifference which he deems to have brought down Japan, and as such gives an insight which the Americanised post-war version of the country does not show, an insight into a culture of sacrifice and honour. Yukio Mishima committed harakiri in 1970 after breaking into a military base in Tokyo with four members of the Tatenokai - a militia of service to the emperor which he founded. 


While I do believe that no book should be off limits, I always suggest this book with the warning that it is not to be taken as a lesson or an example, but merely a story that puts into perspective the vision of the world in the eyes of an idealist of another time, and that Mishima’s views, although extremist, should represent no barrier in the enjoyment of this wonderful work.
