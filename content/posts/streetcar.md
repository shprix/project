When Blanche, a fading southern belle and schoolteacher, moves in with her estranged sister Stella and her rather brutish husband Stanley Kowalski , a string of scandals buried deep within her past are uncovered. In the squalid streets of the poorest quarter of New Orleans, backed by the notes of a blue piano, she is introduced to a world or desperation and violence, and as her new surroundings turn against her, a picture is painted of a fragile person’s descent into lunacy.


As Williams was a progressive writer for his time many social issues are faced, but there is more in that which he leaves unsaid than in that which he shows us plainly; the realities of another time linger in the shadow and give way to a world which in essence is the same as that we inhabit today. 
This timeless play has been made even more popular by its portrait in the movie with bears the same name, made in 1951, starring most memorably **Marlon Brando** as Stanley and **Vivian Leigh** as Blanche, delivering the most famous closing line of all time: ***“Whoever you are …. I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.”***


**“A Streetcar Named Desire”** is doubtlessly one of my favourite books, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get into reading plays, as it is unique and a perfect example of the craftsmanship of one of the most renowned modern playwrights.
