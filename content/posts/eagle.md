In **The Eagle’s Gift**, Castaneda endeavours on a journey different than that of his first novel, “The Teachings of Don Juan”. Castaneda and other men and women regain consciousness of their past after the departure of Don Juan alongside their other teachers. A concept is explained in which one human has a physical body and a luminous body, but also a right (rational) and left (instinctual) side of the conscious, which they can only remember through non-doing, or what we may refer to as a form of meditation. Here there is a plot which revolves around the way in which a group of shamans of different roles is to “leave this world”, through a poem within which death is symbolised by an eagle.


***“I am already given to the power that rules my fate.***

***And I cling to nothing, so I will have nothing to defend. I have no thoughts, so I will see.***

***I fear nothing, so I will remember myself.***

***Detached and at ease, I will dart past the Eagle to be free.”***


While the ideas and rituals described are complex and it is hard at first to follow the plot, especially since it does not occur chronologically, it is very engaging and offers many characters, but I think that its greatest strength is its portrayal of power as wisdom and devotion rather than aggression or intimidation.


I suggest this work to anyone who likes the author or has some form of interest in anthropology, as I do for all of his works, and I think it to be equally mind-opening as his first book, even though more complexly structured and plot-centred.
