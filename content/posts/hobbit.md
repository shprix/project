The uneventful life of Bilbo Baggins is stirred when the wizard Gandalf recruits him as a thief to help a company of 13 dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield to reclaim Erebor, the city beneath The Lonely Mountain, from the dragon Smaug, greatest of the living firedrakes of the north. Journeying through **Middle Earth** he sees how big the world is outside the threshold of his home, and becomes someone he never thought he would be.


**“The Hobbit”** was the first book published about **Middle Earth**. Once Tolkien was checking some of his students’ papers when he scribbled onto a black sheet ***“In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit”***. Later he went on to tell Bilbo’s story to his son, thus having to write it down as not to forget the details. It is much faster and simpler than **“The Lord or the Rings”**, and first introduces us to the hobbits, the small people inhabiting the shire.


It is a fast and fun book, full of interesting characters and humorous events, and yet amidst all that it speaks of bravery and teaches a lesson not to fear but embrace the opportunities we are given, not to be frightened of stepping into the unknown. Anyone who plans on reading **“The Lord or the Rings”** should read **“The Hobbit”**, as it is a beautiful and can amuse both a child and an adult. It is the first step into Tolkien’s world.
