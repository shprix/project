Randle Patrick McMurphy is a Korea war veteran whose rowdy and unlawful lifestyle of brawling and gambling has secured him many years in different penitentiaries all across the countries, ending up in a mental hospital ward after falsifying insanity. However, his dominant persona is too rebellious for ward policy, as he openly clashes with Nurse Ratched, the head nurse of the ward whose role is nothing short of tyrannical - and whose means of commanding obedience are blood-curdling. Chief Bromden, the son of the chief of a native American tribe and a deaf patient of the ward narrates the ongoings of the ward as they change his life and sculpt his path to sanity.


In the 1960’s psychiatry was not what it is today, and in a time when the advance of technology and medicine was as impressive as it was mistrusted and feared, Ken Kesey writes a novel whose characters are perfect depictions of human weaknesses in the micro-universe of the psychiatric ward. The book can be taken as a critique of the system of the time, but it much more profound than that: attacking the prison of the mind which convinces us of our inferiority and corners us into blind obedience, Kesey ignites a flame of revolution and a wish for independence and freedom within such a small environment and set of characters. 


The book was largely celebrated after being popularised by the movie directed by **Milos Forman** and starring **Jack Nicholson, Luise Fletcher, Danny DeVito** and **Will Sampson**, which is one of my favourite films but it is not narrated by Bromden - a sign of the era of the film and its disregard for native Americans, which is a major subject of the novel.


This is a very pride-instilling book that questions the meaning of freedom, and discreetly yet sharply shows how it has been forsaken behind our backs, and what attitude one must take as not to be a servant of power.
