While most readers have heard of J.D. Salinger’s “Catcher in the Rye”, a revolutionary novel that changed the way we think of literature and is now obligatory in many high-schools, fewer are familiar with the author’s other three works.


**“For Esmé - With Love and Squalor”** is a collection of stories by the author, and they portray short periods of time in the lives of different individuals. It humorously tackles the relationships between people, most remarkably those between adults and children — a focal point in the greatest stories of the book. The story of which the book bears the name is a heart-braking tale of a soldier in the second world war who spends some time in England, where he meets a little girl and her brother, before leaving for the front in Germany. The other story which marks the book is the first one in the collection of 12, “A Perfect Day for Bananafish”, the description a Seymour’s sunny morning on a beach in Florida on his honeymoon, with an unexpected twist. 


**“For Esmé - With Love and Squalor”** lives in the reader’s heart somewhere close to sorrow, and even closer to the absurdity of that which is ordinary and extraordinary and in itself makes life unpredictable.
