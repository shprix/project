When fifteen-year-old **Kafka Tamura** runs away from his home in Nakano where he up until the nlived alone with his father, he goes to Takamatsu. On his journey he both desires and fears to find his estranged mother and sister, as his father, an eccentric artist who is symbol of the sinister and macabre, has cursed him from his youth with a curse similar to that of Oedipus Rex (King Oedipus). 


Kafka is however paralleled by another character whose story we follow, **Satoru Nakata**, an old man described as “not very bright”, who survives on a subsidy and has a strange ability to talk to cats.


As these two characters chase and evade their dreams each in his own way, the world changes, the only traces of the magical left resembling a series of unexplained coincidences — giving the particularities of our everyday life a magical aura. 


It is important to understand that in this novel time is translucent, and the supernatural hides in ways that are more than credible, making Tamura’s world very much our own and very distant from the crime novel that it initially resembles. Murakami makes fate seem an unescapable certainty, and through a series of characters with turbulent histories such as Oshima, Miss Saeki and Hoshino, through the light-heartedness and individuality with which they deal with the sorrow and love within he weaves a tale that is the very one that gave birth to a great passion for his writing from my side and that of millions of other readers. 


For me this was the first of Murakami’s books that I read, and my opinion on fiction and on the need for something unknown and magical in a book has completely changed, and as if that were not enough, **“Kaflka on the Shore”** was awarded the ***World Fantasy Award for 2006.***
