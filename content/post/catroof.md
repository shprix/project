As Big Daddy Pollitt, the richest cotton planter in the delta, inches closer to his death, a large family comes together onto his estate to celebrate his birthday and gain his liking, as still, in the belief that he will live, he has written no will to speak of. Two sides fight for his inheritance: his eldest son Gooper, an Atlanta lawyer married to Mae, and father to five “neckless monsters”, and Big Daddy’s second-born, Brick, a retired football star who has turned to alcohol after the death of his friend and the end of his career, who is unhappily married to Maggie “the cat”, a southern beauty who has risen from poverty and fights for the life of her crippling marriage and inheritance of her father-in-law.


The book rotates around a central theme of mendacity — untruthfulness. Greatly celebrated by the 1958 movie adaptation starring **Paul Newman** as Brick and **Elizabeth Taylor** as Maggie, the play bears secrets that come alight in ways which the movie could not portray in 1950s America, and as such even the expectations of one who has seen the movie may be defied by the transparent reality which Tennessee Williams embedded into his work.
**“Cat on a Hot Tin Roof”** has for long served as an example of the horror that lies bring to life, making it a play which is not easily forgotten, but lingers for long in the mind as a memo of how easily things can go terribly wrong. To watch the film and read the play is to see the world in the eyes of an honesty long forgotten in the relationships between people.
