**1Q84** is a world than was born within our own, in Tokyo, in 1984, when Aomame, a personal trainer and freelance hitman, and Tengo, a math teacher and short story writer, notice that there are two moons in the sky, one large and pale and another eerie, small and yellow. The fates of these two characters as uninvolved with each other as may seem grow closer as they each get involved in their own way with the Sakigake religious cult, centred around a prophet-like entity who can communicate with the “little people”, beings that are simultaneously the deity and the antichrist of this world.


Through the intricate histories of each of these characters, this marvellous trilogy explores the estrangement of individuals from their families and the dangers of obsession, but is also infused with the simple and minimalist ways of Japanese culture. The trilogy is a thousand-page page-turner that you will not be able to let down until you finish it.


In this book **Murakami** shows what I deem to be his greatest virtue, which is writing fiction in a way that incorporates it into our world discreetly and showing us how fictional our own world might be, and how easy it is to credibly replace what we take as granted with something magical, thus adding that element of the unknown into everyday life — and here he manages to pull it off with one of if not the greatest value of society - the divine. 


This books truly spoils the reader as when that last page ends, an adventure seems to have gone by, and for quite a while it will linger in the mind making sure that you are not the same person you were when you first delved into 1Q84. For me it was the start of an interest for spirituality.
