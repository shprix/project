**The Teachings of Don Juan** is a book which, while often referred to as a fiction novel, was an anthropology work written by Castaneda when he went to Mexico, where he met a Yaqui Indian shaman  by the name of Don Juan Matus, beside whom he explored spirituality, power, and knowledge in the traditional Yaqui procedures using plants and fungi, achieving what we in the western world can only label as magic. Through Don Juan’s explanations of the effects of the hallucinogenic peyote plant, the devil weed, and the “little smoke” (Psylocibe Mexicana), one can learn not only about the mystical experiences of this people, but also many philosophical concepts on power and how it enslaves people, and on the path to becoming a “man of knowledge”, and to what are four of man’s enemies in that path.


While many may be sceptic towards the value of this work, I feel that it has much to teach us, and that we can all be amazed at the wisdom of a society such as the Yaqui Indians who have lived much more symbiotically with nature than we do, and bear a love and respect for it which the first world has started seeking again only when it’s misdeeds showed their first consequences. 


This book was part of a large movement of writing that tended towards exploring the mystical and spiritual, and it is only the reader’s choice wether it will be challenging to their beliefs or eye-opening.


In my experience this book was one of the first steps to opening a gap in the cold world of rationality and shining a light on the immense world of what is unknown to us and yet encompasses us — I would recommend this book and and all other works on this website from this author (see “The Eagle’s Gift”) to people who are struggling with reality and are seeking a new way to look at things, or who are interested in the world of a people that has almost perished.
