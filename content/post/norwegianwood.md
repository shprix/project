As he approaches Hamburg airport, Toru Watanabe hears the Beatle’s song **“Norwegian Wood”**, and goes on a journey of recalling his time as a student in Tokyo, of recalling his relationships with Naoko, the girlfriend of his deceased best friends Kizuki, and Midori, a girl he meets at university, and how they shaped his life.


The book illustrates the world of Japan in the late 60s, a futuristic society looking hopefully to the west. It paints a vibrant picture of its age with student uprisings, a Kafka-like disgust for bureaucracy, and most remarkably with music — featuring songs form **The Beatles, The Doors, Cream** and others, this book has a soundtrack of its own that takes us back to the time of the writer’s youth as if we had inhabited it (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVOYpscuRCy5fePBAf3FP3D1G1LviJCl3 link to playlist on youtube).  


While many have criticised Murakami for writing this novel that initially seems like any other autobiographical fiction love story, after reading through the novel it is clear that it is by no means ordinary, and by no means an autobiographical fiction love story. This was the book that marked his popularity and is considered a classic nowadays in Japan. His skilfulness gleams through his attitude towards serious subjects such as depression, suicide, social injustice and sacrifice, culminating in what may be one of the most beautiful passages on the death of a loved one and on the void left behind.


***“Once upon a time, you dragged a part of me into the world of the dead.”***


In my experience a book that speaks of the losses and troubles of another is always one that stimulates empathy in oneself, one that forbids indifference — I think everyone ought to read this book, as some things are common to all humans, and grief is certainly one of them.
