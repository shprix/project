The life of **David Zimmer**, a university professor, crumbles to pieces after the unexpected death of his wife and kids, driving him into madness and self isolation. Ultimately, as to start a new life away from his grief, he quits his job and dedicates himself to writing a book on **Hector Mann**, a silent movie actor gone missing in the 1920s and never heard of since, thus unknowingly uncovering the actors unknown fate — one quite similar to his own.


This novel’s greatest achievement is that it maintains a lively and intriguing plot while still confronting the subject of grief, but quite differently that we are used to. The grief of the book’s characters is one that is backed by guilt, and as such takes them on a journey of redemption, sparks within them a need to pay a price for staying alive, and also one that makes them stronger through the many losses that they go through. The parallels drawn between seemingly unaffiliated characters are remarkable, and it is hard not to marvel at Auster’s storytelling skill, and even at his writing skill when one such as myself reads the whole novel only to notice after 300 pages that the author does not use quotation marks, and yet tells a story all the same.


This definitely is a book for everyone - fun, quick, and at times serious, it serves as a perfect example of what a modern fiction novel should accomplish.
