While most readers have heard of J.D. Salinger’s “Catcher in the Rye”, a revolutionary novel that changed the way we think of literature and is now obligatory in many high-schools, fewer are familiar with the author’s other three works. 


**“Franny and Zooey”** is one of these. When Franny goes to meet with her boyfriend on his university campus something goes wrong, and she returns home, where, giving us an insight into the lives of a sister and brother through a discussion, the author manages to deconstruct society itself, but unlike “”The Catcher in the Rye” does so in a merciful and graceful way rather than an angry one. The good-natured and naive nature of Franny and the rational and sharp personality of her brother Zooey clash and spirituality, ego and hypocrisy are debated as Zooey dismantles his sisters convictions. The author shows off his skill in writing, his perceptiveness to human emotion, and his immense culture on a series of subjects.
This is my personal favourite out of Salinger’s novels since it has challenged me to shift my understanding of people to a more emphatic position. As such its greatest strengths are the endearing traits of different characters which portray mourning, motherhood, fragility, obsession, and most prominently love.
