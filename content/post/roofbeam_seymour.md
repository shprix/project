While most readers have heard of J.D. Salinger’s “Catcher in the Rye”, a revolutionary novel that changed the way we think of literature and is now obligatory in many high-schools, fewer are familiar with the author’s other three works.


**“Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters; & Seymour - an Introduction”** is another book by the author, or rather two books, as it is divided into two separate parts. The first part is the story of Buddy, a soldier returning from the second world war, who goes to his brother Seymour’s wedding. However, Seymour and his soon-to-be wife do not turn up and go on their honeymoon instead, leaving the guests, all unfamiliar to Buddy since he is the only guest of the groom. This story has a way of exposing people’s complexes and insecurities through different characters: a deaf and mute dwarf who smiles ceaselessly, a hotheaded and  quick-to-judge matron of honor, and her army officer husband who is obsessed with other men’s military rank.


The second part, **“Seymour — an Introduction”** is far from a story. It is a book where the author speaks as if he were Buddy, the soldier previously mentioned, writing a book about Seymour, who is now deceased. Through the lens of admiration for this simultaneously perfect and imperfect brother some philosophical concepts from the meaning of art to the writer’s understanding of the divine are delved into, and even though this part has no plot to speak of, it paints a clear picture of love


For me this book has great importance because in the wondrous task of writing two books in one about a character without him making more than one appearance, Salinger has illustrated the change in the kind of love that is felt for a person while alive and then when they leave us. As each of his works it tackles mourning in a different yet realistic way.
