Jack Torrance is a college professor and writer whose temper and drinking habits have lost him his job, making him move with his wife Wendy and son Danny all over the country in search of work, ending up as caretaker of The Overlook Hotel while out of season, but The Overlook is no ordinary hotel — as the pass of the rocky mountains is snowed in the hotel develops a life of its own, and its bloody history comes to light. All of this is very troubling to Danny, who just like the hotel, is all but ordinary. He ***‘shines’***. He can hear people’s thoughts and see things that might or might not happen, and the hotel scares him more than anything in the world. 

There is a reason why **“The Shining”** might be Stephen King’s most renowned work, which is no small feat since at the time of this review the author has written 61 novels. It simply does not take more than a fistful of faith for the spirits of The Overlook to  come alive;  the fantastic element of the book is not just one from the author’s imagination, but from our own. ***How many times have we run as fast as we could from a room after turning of the light as a child? How many times has our heart skipped a beat when we were children upon seeing a shadow on the wall just to see that it was the family cat or a pile of clothes on a chair?*** Our childhood fears are the fuel of Stephen King’s iconic terror novel.

While you cannot expect all of the author’s 61 novels to be as good as this one, he has produces some classics, and **“The Shining”** is one of these, and it is sure to be remembered as a masterpiece of horror literature. To read this book at night in a dimly lit room is to relive a childhood fear.
