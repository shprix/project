From disappearing elephants to hijackings of bakeries and burning of barns, to divorces over a pair of shorts, **“The Elephant Vanishes”** is a collection of short stories that will make any reader smile with their witty descriptions and unconventional illustrations of everyday life, and of that which although seemingly unexceptional makes one day unlike another. These stories show a modern world whose particularities can make it funny, weird, or even downright unsettling. 


All stories are united by a need to attack normality and tear it apart, revealing the secret passions or impulsive actions of people, or showcasing the split worlds of family life or social life and an intimate vision of the self ***— absurdity is made understandable to a reader to the point where he starts embracing it.***


This is what I call a “summer book”, a book that you read on the beach under the sun and let it take you under its wing, a book that will fly by you showing you a side of this author that is buried deep within his greater works but shines through this one.
