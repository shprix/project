In the third age of the great and ancient world of ***Middle earth***, the old evil of Sauron rises again, and the fate of the world lies in the hands not of men, elves, or dwarves, but in those of an unlikely and peaceful people; hobbits. Led by Gandalf the grey, Frodo and his company endeavour on a journey to stop the great darkness that grows in the east. Battles are fought of hosts of good and evil and unlikely friendships are struck — in the fight against evil a world unites around a dim light of hope.


Tolkien’s world is a perfect reflection of our own and is illuminating as it shows how real evil is, and how it is not our choice but our duty to fight it; by illustrating a breathtaking world filled with heroes and legends only did he show how vain our lives are when we await our fates motionless and let other powers steer history. In **“The Lord or the Rings”** each individual may help change the world in his own way either through his bravery and boldness, through his wisdom, or simply through his kindness, but most importantly through love, or as Tolkien says, the warrior loves not the sword and spear, but only that which they defend.


There are some books who speak of one thing, and there are some that speak of everything. **“The Lord or the Rings”** contains not only the author’s words but his soul. As he speaks of great battles and fallen warriors there is nothing that he invents, but he speak of the friends that he himself lost on the battlefield, and as he speaks of ***Middle Earth*** devastated by wartime he speaks of his home when he came back from The Great War. As he writes his magnum opus, a new enemy arises within our own world; as he writes of Sauron’s hate and destruction he writes of a fragile Europe before the evil of Hitler. The fact that **“The Lord or the Rings”** is a fantasy novel is of no importance when it comes to the truth that lies within its thousand pages, and to the amount of wisdom poured into it. So much can be learned from a book that distances the reader form reality into ***Middle Earth***. 


***Middle Earth*** breathes and exist not only in **“The Lord or the Rings”** but also in J.R.R. Tolkien’s other work, from **‘The Hobbit’** to **‘The Silmarillion’** and **‘The Children of Hurin’**. You will inevitably search for these books after you fall in love with **“The Lord or the Rings”**.
