In a world where humans are made in hatcheries and conditioning centres and divided into castes based on their intelligence, where there is no family and ‘everyone belongs to everyone’, where drugs are the favourite social pastime, a perfect world of happy consumers has been created. When Bernard Marx, a high-ranking but unhappy member of this society, visits a Savage Reserve, where life is as it was before, his life turns around.


Huxley speaks of a time in the future where little is remembered of our time, and yet the more we meet this brainwashed world, the more we see some striking familiarities. **“Brave New World”** has often been compared to **“Nineteen Eighty-Four”** by George Orwell, probably the most famous dystopian novel ever, except that Huxley’s world menaces us through the bright smile of an apparent utopia, and draws nearer every day as pleasure and social standing replace love and sympathy. To quote J.G. Ballard:


***“Huxley was uncannily prophetic, a more astute guide to the future than any other 20th-century novelist… Nineteen Eighty-Four has never really arrived, but Brave New World is around us everywhere.”***


This is a novel that bears a great message of individuality, commanding the reader to reflect how his/her traits mirror their time and social surroundings and to break free form those negative qualities that are this time’s mark. No one can read Huxley’s masterpiece without seeing the absurdity of the present and feel a need to break free of it, growing a conscious and moral compass independent of our surroundings. 


I wish all people would read **“Brave New World”** and truly understand it, because it would certainly make for a better future. This is a must of modern literature, and as all good dystopian novels it is not only to be taken as a story but as a warning.
