Ernest Hemingway is renowned for his simplistic and direct writing style that reflects his adventurous life - wartime stories, beautiful sceneries, brawls, travel and tangible characters.


**“The First Forty-nine Stories”** is a collection of short stories written by Hemingway between 1921 and 1938, the first four being written last. It is these four (***“The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber”, “The Capital of the World”, “The Snows of Kilimanjaro”*** and ***“Old Man at the Bridge”***) that I personally like the most. These first four stories speak of sudden, unexpected deaths, all different in their own way, from the accidental one of an innocent boy who never said his goodbyes, to the slow and agonising one of an old man determined to hold a grudge against those close to him, to the livelihood of an elder in Spain swept away by war from one day to another. Each of these are undramatic, but simple and bare of description. Hemingway needs no more than a few simple words to convey tragedy, never watered down by a description in excess. 


The other forty-five stories are small events, like souvenirs of what was going through his mind as he traveled the world, short snippets of love, fear, hate or pity in everyday lives of everyday characters - these show a love for humanity alongside its imperfections that few works can bring to life. 


I recommend reading the stories after going through a short biography of Hemingway’s life, since as every character is a little piece of the writer, you will be able to locate each story into his life and appreciate how personal they are. Although they are all deserving of immense praise, my two personal favourites are ***“The Capital of the World”*** and ***“Cat in the Rain”***, but also a short paragraph titled ***“Chapter III”***.
