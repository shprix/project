Martha and George, a middle-aged married couple, professors at a New England college, invite Nick and Honey, two new arrivals at the campus, to a hangout at their house. Before them they exhibit a spectacle of marital woes, from humiliation to mockery and violence, and fuelled by alcohol and years of unhappy matrimony their secret comes to light. 


This play is considered a masterpiece on relationships, a perfect show of the aggressive and passive-aggressive , of how suppressed feeling and violation of intimacy can destroy. As the play escalates, what seemed to be an entertaining night with a funny couple in the first act, in the second becomes a confrontation of characters where the worst of each is shown to a point where the rage and anxiousness become present within the reader himself. In fact, the second act appropriately bears the name of **“Walpurgisnacht”**, a pagan ritual against witchcraft, which here shows the breakdown of civilisation.


This play is also celebrated by one of my favourite movies of all time with **Elizabeth Taylor** and **Richard Burton** as Martha and George, whose adaptation from 1966 is as striking and ruthless as the play itself, possibly because the actors themselves remarried each other twice. I strongly recommend watching it as it can be hard to imagine scenes from a play without having some reference. This play should definitely make its way onto your reading list as it will leave anyone awestruck towards the feeling that it transmits.
